        <h3>Youtube's playlist interface is silly</h3>
        <p>
          It may work fine in some cases, but I find it struggling when playlists have more and more items. I personally
          have one or two with hundreds of videos (respectively food and bass covers), and you cannot have them all
          displayed in one go, everything is <em>paginated with 50 max items per lot</em>, with the next batch of videos
          fetched once you reach the bottom of the page. So, searching a specific title is out of the question. Don't
          get me started on the time it takes to scroll through it.

          Why not load <em>all</em> videos in a playlist at once ?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The funny thing is that it is actually provided as an{' '}
          <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/playlistItems/list?hl=en#examples" target="_blank">
            example in youtube API's docs
          </a>
          . When you call it to get playlist items, one of the (optional) parameters is <code>pageToken</code>. It lets
          the API load the "page" of data you want to load. And, in the response, if there are still more items to be
          fetched, you will find a <code>nextPageToken</code>. So you just have to repeatedly query the API until{' '}
          <code>nextPageToken</code> is no longer present, and there you have it ! The <em>entire</em> playlist content.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd rather wait a few seconds (it takes ~8 seconds for about a thousand videos) upfront and then browse freely
          than repeatedly have stop and wait üòä

          is really simple: you log in with your youtube account, it fetches your playlists, and if you click one of
          them it fetches the videos within.
